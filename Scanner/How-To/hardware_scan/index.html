<p>Do this only if you want to control the hardware and scan plants with the open-source scanner!</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-started" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>To follows this guide you should have a <code>conda</code> or a Python <code>venv</code>, see <a href="/Scanner/how-to/#how-to-install-romi-packages">here</a></p>
<h3 id="install-romi-packages-with-pip">Install ROMI packages with <code>pip</code>:<a class="headerlink" href="#install-romi-packages-with-pip" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Since this is still under development, the packages are installed in "editable mode" with the <code>-e</code> option.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="install-romiscanner">Install <code>romiscanner</code>:<a class="headerlink" href="#install-romiscanner" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>To pilot the hardware you have to install the <code>romiscanner</code>package:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pip install -e git+https://github.com/romi/romiscanner.git@dev
</code></pre></div></p>
<h4 id="install-romiscan">Install <code>romiscan</code>:<a class="headerlink" href="#install-romiscan" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>To start "acquisition jobs", you have to install the <code>romiscan</code> package:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pip install -e git+https://github.com/romi/romiscan.git@dev
</code></pre></div></p>
<h4 id="install-romidata">Install <code>romidata</code>:<a class="headerlink" href="#install-romidata" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>Since we will need an active database to export the acquisitions, you have to install the <code>romidata</code> package:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pip install -e git+https://github.com/romi/romidata.git@dev
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>To quickly create an example DB you can use:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>wget https://db.romi-project.eu/models/test_db.tar.gz
tar -xf test_db.tar.gz
</code></pre></div>
This will create a <code>integration_tests</code> folder with a ready to use test database. </p>

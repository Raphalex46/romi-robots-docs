<p>To follows this guide you should have a <code>conda</code> or a Python <code>venv</code>, see <a href="/Scanner/how-to/#how-to-install-romi-packages">here</a></p>

<p>If you want to use the virtual scanner, the blender and python version have to match.
To obtain the python version bundled with your distribution of blender, type:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>blender -b --python-expr <span class="s2">&quot;import sys; print(sys.version)&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>It will output something like:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Blender 2.82 (sub 7) (hash 5b416ffb848e built 2020-02-14 16:19:45)

3.8.1 (default, Jan 22 2020, 06:38:00) 
[GCC 9.2.0]

Blender quit
</code></pre></div>
In this case, this means Blender bundle Python 3.8 and you should too.</p>
<p>In the following, we will assume that you are using conda environments.
If not, adapt with corresponding virtualenv commands.</p>

<p>If you're using <code>python&gt;=3.7</code> and <code>conda</code>, just install <code>lpy</code> from conda:

<h2 id="basic-usage">Basic usage<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-usage" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>The virtual scanner works like an HTTP server using Blender.
First, make sure you have <code>blender</code> (&gt;= 2.80) installed on your machine.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">

Then, clone the directory and access it:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>git clone git@github.com:romi/blender_virtual_scanner.git
<span class="nb">cd</span> blender_virtual_scanner
</code></pre></div></p>
</div>
<p>You can obtain sample data for the scanner here, and put it in the data folder.
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>wget https://db.romi-project.eu/models/arabidopsis_data.zip
unzip arabidopsis_data.zip -d data
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>To use custom data, it must consist in <code>.obj</code> file, in which each type of organ corresponds to a distinct mesh.
This mesh must have a single material whose name is the name of the organ.
The data dir must contain the <code>obj</code> and <code>mtl</code> files.</p>
<p>Additionally, background HDRI files can be downloaded from (hdri haven)[<a href="https://hdrihaven.com/">https://hdrihaven.com/</a>].
Download <code>.hdr</code> files and put them in the <code>hdri</code> folder.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">

It will start an HTTP server on port <code>5000</code>.</p>

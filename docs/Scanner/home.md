Plant scanner overview
======================

Hereafter we illustrate the different components of the plant scanner and their interactions.

User story:

1. The user put his/her plant inside the scanner and run **acquisitions**, which returns a set of images per plant.
2. These images are uploaded to a **central database**.
3. The user **defines a pipeline** to reconstruct and quantify plants architecture by choosing among a set of predefined methods and algorithms. These instructions may be run by a distant server.
4. Finally the user can access the acquisitions, reconstructions & quantitative data by connecting to a visualization server using his/her computer

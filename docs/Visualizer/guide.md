## The scans list page

When first opening the app, you will be greeted with a home
page displaying every available scans. From this page, you can
search for specific keywords, order the scans by their name, date, etc.
And filter results according to what data is available on each scan.

!!! note
    If you're a developer, you can download the metadata 
    and archives associated with each scan as well.

## The viewer

When clicking the *Open* button next to a scan, the actual viewer
app will appear. You can do a bunch of things from this page.

### The 3D reconstruction

On the left, you will find the 3D view. From this view, you can observe the 
reconstructed plant and navigate around. Don't hesitate to hover over elements
of the interface to get information about them.

Feel free to experiment with the different features and tools of the 3D view.

### The graphs

On the right side, you will find panels with graphs in them. The help tooltips
do a great job at explaining what those graphs are, so feel free to check them 
out.

By clicking on these graphs you can select pairs of organs to highlight them and
display more accurate information of their measures.

Finally, you can download the data in CSV or TSV format thanks to the download
buttons at the top of each graph.

### The photo carousel

At the bottom of the page, you will find a carousel with a bunch of photos.
Those are the original photos taken for the scan, and you can click on them to
display them along with the reconstructed plant. This is useful to see if the
reconstructed plant is accurate or not.
